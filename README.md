# Challenge 1 - Code Refactor Horiseon

## Description

This is a webpage for Horiseon. The webpage needed a code refactoring in order to meet accesibility standards. The refactor included:
- Adding alt tags to images
- Adding a title
- Consolidating the HTML and CSS to minimize the use of redundant classes and lines

This taught me how to streamline code and look up technical documentation on accesibility standards.
